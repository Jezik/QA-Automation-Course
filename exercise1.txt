1. Go to https://www.saucedemo.com/
Prepare python file with variables for xpath and css selectors for elements:

-login input
-password input
-login button

then login to app (credentials on page :)
-menu hamburger button (left right corner)
-all items (from hamburger menu)
-about (from hamburger menu)
-logout (from hamburger menu)
-reset app stata (from hamburger menu)
-cross to close hamburger menu
-add to card button for 1st item
-add to card button for 3rd item
-cart button

my proposal for naming is like this: 
LOGIN_BUTTON_XPATH = "//button[@id='login']"
LOGIN_BUTTON_CSS = "button#login"

once you finished it, please commit it to repo and ping me to check :)
